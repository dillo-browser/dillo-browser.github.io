<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This document adds UNIX sockets support to URLs by using host names with the TLD
&ldquo;.unix&rdquo; and a unix.hosts file that describe where in the file system
the socket file is located for a given host.</p>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>UNIX sockets allow permissions to be established on a socket so that only a user
or a group of users can connect to it. However, the HTTP protocol doesn&rsquo;t make
provisions to specify how to connect to UNIX sockets, and instead it uses TCP
to connect to a given host, which is resolved via DNS to an IP address.</p>

<p>To allow connecting to UNIX sockets, we propose using a special top level
domain (TLD) &ldquo;.unix&rdquo; which can be mapped to a local UNIX socket. In
this way, an URL like the following:</p>

<pre><code>http://example.unix/index.html
</code></pre>

<p>Will search for a socket file mapped to &ldquo;example.unix&rdquo; and
perform a HTTP query over that socket to retrieve the &ldquo;/index.html&rdquo;
file. Similarly, other protocols like Gopher or Gemini can work with UNIX
sockets in the same way.</p>

<p>This scheme allows a user to place the sockets in any path of their choosing,
which doesn&rsquo;t need to be revealed in the URL.</p>

<p>To support this scheme, a unix.hosts file is be used with a similar syntax as
the hosts file, in such a way that a user can define its own aliases:</p>

<pre><code>unix:~/.dillo/example.sock    example.unix
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, a system-wide configuration could be made available, and still
inherit the benefits from UNIX permissions:</p>

<pre><code>unix:/var/lib/foobar.sock     foobar.unix
</code></pre>

<p>This proposal fails gracefully when a URL referring to a UNIX socket is
opened by a program that doesn&rsquo;t support UNIX hosts, as the top level
domain &ldquo;.unix&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t exist
[<a href="https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt">1</a>].
Additionally, a program may determine that a host ending with .unix will use a
UNIX connection, so it is not needed to query any DNS server.</p>

<p>If no entry is found on the unix.hosts file for a given .unix host a default
set of locations for the UNIX socket could be attempted, but this is left out of
the current proposal.</p>

<h2>Implementation details</h2>

<p>This proposal could be implemented by any program that performs network
operations, it is not specific to Dillo. The following sections apply only to
Dillo itself, but may serve as a reference to other implementations.</p>

<h3>The unix.hosts file</h3>

<p>The format of the hosts file extends the syntax of /etc/hosts to allow hosts
that begin with the &ldquo;unix:&rdquo; prefix and are followed by a path. The
rest of the line defines aliases to that socket separated by white-spaces.</p>

<pre><code>unix:/var/lib/foobar.sock  foobar.unix
</code></pre>

<p>The symbol ~ is expanded by the value of the <code>$HOME</code> variable of
the user performing the lookup. Therefore, to define sockets in the user home
directory:</p>

<pre><code>unix:~/foobar.sock  foobar.unix  foo-bar.unix
</code></pre>

<h3>UNIX host resolution</h3>

<p>The process to resolve a UNIX host is quite simple. First, determine if the
URL host name ends in &ldquo;.unix&rdquo;. If so, follow the steps below.
Otherwise, proceed with the current host resolution, possibly querying DNS
servers.</p>

<p>To find how to connect to a .unix host, identify a matching entry in the
hosts.unix file by looking at all the aliases for each UNIX socket. If there is
a match, use the unix socket patch of that line and the socket() interface with
the <code>AF_UNIX</code> family.</p>

<h3>Multiple entries</h3>

<p>In order to give users the ability to redefine aliases to their own UNIX
sockets, the entries in the unix.hosts file have precedence over the ones in the
system-wide unix.hosts configuration file.</p>
