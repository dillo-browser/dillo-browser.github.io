<br><br><h2>Basically, what's the Dillo project about?</h2>

<p>
The project objectives are:
<ul>
  <li> The democratization of Internet information access.
  <li> Security and personal privacy.
  <li> High software efficiency.
</ul>
<p>
and for that we're developing a web browser that is:
<ul>
  <li> Completely written in C.
  <li> Less than 300KB (Yes, KILOBYTES!).
  <li> Free Software under the GPL license.
  <li> Working on a
    <a href='Compatibility.html'>broad range</a>
    of hardware platforms
  <li> Very fast.
</ul>
<p>
In fact, with Dillo, a 486 PC and a telephone line is enough
to enjoy a good Internet connection.
<p>
Dillo's  efficiency  allows it to work even on a personal digital
assistant (pocket sized computer).
<p>
In  summary:  we're developing a web browser that allows the user
fast,  secure  and  efficient  access  to  the  wide  information
spectrum  of the Internet, keeping the hardware requirements to a
minimum. 

<br><br><h2>What would be the main use for Dillo?</h2>

<p>
Information access!
<p>
Dillo  could  open the doors of a new Internet experience to tens
of millions of people in the world.
<p>
It  is  important to know that the entry barriers to Internet are
_artificial_. They were created and sustained with a view to make
better business profits.
<p>
(If you purchase a computer of the current year, renew it every
two  or three, and in addition pay monthly for broadband service,
it  is  much more expensive than keeping your computer and paying
the phone bill)
<p>
 Now  you know: you don't need a modern computer and broadband
for Internet access.

<br><br><h2>It  is mentioned that Dillo could be used even on a 486. Is there
an "ideal" distribution for this kind of equipment?</h2>

<p>
There  is  a  large  number of so-called minimalist distributions
seeking  to  accomodate  different  degrees  of "smallness". They
range in size from a single diskette to a few tens of Megabytes.
<p>
I  haven't tested them yet! - but I installed Slackware (3.5
IIRC) on a 66Mhz 486DX once and it worked flawlessly.
<p>
Now, considering that 
<a href='http://distrowatch.gds.tuwien.ac.at/drinou'>Drinou Linux</a>
is based on Slackware, and includes a  packaged
dillo-0.6.6,  I'd  recommend  it, and this is the one I'd give a try to
power a 486 machine.

<br><br><h2>Is an estimate of the size of Dillo's userbase known?</h2>

<p>
That's  very hard to estimate, since dillo is not distributed from
our  site alone:  there are Debian packages, rpm, ipk, *BSD, etc.
scattered   through  cyberspace.  There  are  also  distributions
including it in their base systems.
<p>
If  the source package alone is considered (an option far less
used  than  an .rpm), dillo-0.6.6 must have near 20,000 downloads
from our site.
<p>
We'd have to add a larger amount to that number.
<p>
Eventually I'll come up with a way to count them all!

<br><br><h2>How has the acceptance of Dillo been in the GNU/Linux community?</h2>

<p>
Very very good!
<p>
I've noticed that from the people who take some time to write and
thank  us  for  the  benefit they get from using Dillo, we've got
more fans than users.
<p>
It  is  extraordinarily enriching to receive the thankful letters
from so many people from such diverse parts of the world.

<br><br><h2>How is the development of Dillo done?</h2>

<p>
Dillo  is  an  international  project  with developers of diverse
nationalities  collaborating from their respective countries. All
of this is made possible by integrating several technologies that
allow  the  configuration  of what we may call a "virtual office"
over the Internet space.
<p>
The   group   consists of   two  core  developers,  three  steady
developers and several freelance ones.
<p>
The  geographic  distribution  of its members is mainly in Europe
and South America!
<p>
Among the main technologies we use to create our working space we
have: HTTP servers, CGI, log analyzer, bug tracker, web browsers,
shell  servers,  mailing  lists,  ssh,  CVS,  FTP,  IRC, scripts,
python,  gcc/gdb,  POSIX-compliant operating systems, debuggers,
release publishers, ..., and the English language!


<br><br><h2>Why GTK+ and not QT?</h2>

<p>
For  several reasons. The main one is that when the Dillo project
started,  the  QT  libraries were not Free Software (that changed
later).  Moreover,  by  that time, they were developing the KHTML
library for their future web browser (Konqueror).
<p>
On  the  other  hand,  gzilla  was based on GTK+, and it was Free
Software,  and the image rendering extensions I was planning were
assured because GTK+ was the basis for the GIMP!


<br><br><h2>The fact that Dillo is programmed in C makes it portable to other
operating  systems.  Shouldn't  Windows be your principal target,
considering  that  the  "democratization  of Internet" would have
more impact because of the larger userbase of this OS?</h2>

<p>
Definitely NOT.
<p>
Let's  go by parts: the fact that Dillo is programmed in C is not
a  guarantee  of portability. In fact, library dependence is much
more important.
<p>
If  the  libraries  are  portable,  or  have  equivalent APIs, is
relatively  straightforward  to make a version for the supporting
platform.  If  the  function libraries do not exist in the target
platform, porting becomes a titanic task.
<p>
On  to  the other part, the endeavour of democratizing the access
to Internet is very much tied to these two facts:
<ul>
  <li> Dillo keeps the hardware requirements low and constant.
  <li> You don't need to pay software licenses to use Free Software.
</ul>
<p>
Micro$oft  (windoze)  is  the  exact  opposite, and even more, it
artificially  raises  the  hardware requirements. If someone uses
that  platform,  he  will have to renew his computer periodically
(to  do  the same things he was doing before), and also pay a new
license every time there's an "upgrade".
<p>
If, on the other hand, a Free Software platform such as GNU/Linux
(with dillo) is opted for, an old or new computer can be used for
as long as the hardware lasts, without fearing that it will
stop  working.  And, of course, there is no need to pay a license
fee.
<p>
The  second  option  allows  people  who  are without an Internet
connection because of its "high costs" to enjoy the advantages of
the information era.
<p>
It is true that there's a need to educate and inform that:
<ul>
  <li> It is FALSE that you need to renew your computer every three
    years.
  <li> It is FALSE that you need an ultra modern computer to connect
    to the Internet.
  <li> It is FALSE that you can't have good internet access with a
    phone line.
</ul>
<p>
Those  myths  (when  taken  as  true)  are  only  the  basis of a
multi-million  dollar  business  that  exploits those who believe
them!


<br><br><h2>What does being the project coordinator imply?</h2>

<p>
Responsibility, knowledge, consistency and leadership.


<br><br><h2>Do organization problems arise?</h2>

<p>
Yes, as in every group dynamic, but along very particular lines.
<p>
Maybe  the  most  interesting  among  them  is  that as this is a
project  made  of  volunteers, you can't demand that someone do a
certain task, in certain way, in a fixed amount of time.
<p>
When you want someone to perform or do a certain task, it must be
founded very well to make an agreement, and it must coincide with
the particular interest area of that developer.
<p>
Another  point  worthy  of notice is that sometimes very valuable
time  is  wasted explaining/coordinating/delimiting how some task
should be done to someone, only to finally get (after a trial) an
explanation for not being able to do it.


<br><br><h2>Has it demanded much of your time?</h2>

<p>
In the Dillo project I have two jobs:
<ul>
  <li> Project coordinator.
  <li> Lead developer.
</ul>
<p>
Moreover, considering the enormous complexity and dynamism of the
underlying  technologies  for  a  web  browser,  it  is  easy  to
understand that there's much more work than time.
<p>
In  fact,  since  the project's beginning, I've worked full time,
three years, including weekends.


<br><br><h2>What platform (GNU/Linux distro) do you use for developing Dillo?</h2>

<p>
I  use  Slackware,  but in the development group there are people
using  NetBSD,  FreeBSD,  OpenBSD,  Solaris,  and other GNU/Linux
distros,  so  our  software  is  tested  on  a  broad spectrum of
platforms before making each release.
<p>
 In  my  opinion,  Slackware is the best distribution for one
who  knows what he's doing, or wants to learn well the technical
rationale of a GNU/Linux environment.


<br><br><h2>How and when did you start with GNU/Linux?</h2>

<p>
I  should  say around 1996, with Slackware 3.5 or 3.6, but I used
"monkey linux" over a DOS filesystem before (kernel 2.0.30!).
<p>
Anyway, my first steps on Unix environments were by 1990.


<br><br><h2>Why do you state Dillo is Free Software and not Open Source?</h2>

<p>
Short answer:
<ul>
  <li> Free Software is a social movement.
  <li> Open Source is just a development technique.
</ul>
<p>
Medium sized answer:
<p>
After  knowing  there's a high-end operating system, developed by
volunteers   around   the   world  in  their  free  time,  that's
distributed  as  Free  Software (which implies among other things
that  you can use it without paying licences), any intellectually
inclined  person  starts  to  wonder  what motivates the group to
devote their time to such an endeavour.
<p>
The answer is about a shared ethic and philosophy of such force
that  it's able to create a social movement based on its members'
convictions.  Unified  by  a  common  element,  Free Software (or
Software Libre), under the shelter of the GPL.
<p>
It's silly to think that it's just for the joy of programming, or
even worse, for a development technique.
<br><br>

What is Free Software?
<p>
It is a type of Software that grants four basic freedoms:
<ul>
  <li> Freedom to use the program, for any purpose.
  <li> Freedom to study how the program works and to adapt it to
    your needs (source code access).
  <li> Freedom to copy and distribute (you can help your neighbour).
  <li> Freedom to improve the program and make the enhancements
    available so all the community benefits.
</ul>
<p>
In  simple  terms,  the  GPL  license is the legal mechanism that
obliges  that  when  the program is redistributed, those freedoms
can't  be  restricted,  denied  or  restrained, so they are fully
preserved for the recipients.
<p>
i.e.  software  under  the GPL will always deliver the four basic
freedoms stated above.
<p>
These  simple  elements  have  been creating an enormous software
base, shared by lots of people around the world. In fact, all the
GNU  software  and  the  Linux kernel are under the GPL. They are
Free Software.
<p>
But, what motivates this movement's members?
<p>
The  answer to this question is very broad, including the generic
level, and probably I'll write about it on other occasion, but it
is  worth  a remark to note that for an abstract analytical mind,
the  answer  may come from the analysis of competitive societies,
interchange communities and cooperation societies.
<p>
Moreover,  the  famous "prisoner's dilemma" sheds a lot of light on
this matter.
<p>
A detailed answer (in English) can be found by reading about the
<a href='http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html'>GNU
project philosophy</a>.


<br><br><h2>What  do  you  think  about  the  fact  that  most  people  don't
distinguish between Free Software and Open Source?</h2>

<p>
It's not rare, as the term was coined in some respects to confuse.
<p>
The  Free  Software  movement (Software Libre) antecedes the Open
Source  Software  (OSS) definition by far. In fact, if I remember
correctly, the GNU/Linux system existed and was already operative
before the term 'OSS' was coined.
<p>
In  a  few  words,  it  happened  that  as Free Software produced
reticence  inside  the  business  world  (because it was oriented
towards the freedoms the end user received), a small group made a
pragmatic  decision:  to  conceal  the  ethical and philosophical
aspects,  presenting  Free  Software as a development methodology
and not as the movement it is.
<p>
Thus,  they  elaborated an OSS definition broad enough to include
Free  Software within a larger set (and thus to be able to claim that
certain software is OSS when in fact it is Free Software).
<p>
The  problem  is  that  OSS  allows  denying some of the freedoms
granted by Free Software.
<p>
The funny thing is, they had a tremendous success, and as most of
the written media makes its income from advertising (paid for by
enterprises),  they  decide to keep on using the OSS term and not
to offend their clients.
<p>
The  point is, those who learned about GNU/Linux's existence from
that media began thinking it was OSS.
<p>
Today,  the  OSS  term  has caused much harm to the Free Software
Foundation and to the GNU project, whose achievements they declare
to be those of OSS, while concealing the underlying philosophy.
<p>
In  fact,  it was a double-edged sword: on one hand it opened the
entry  door to the enterprise, and on the other, it concealed the
most important part: a matter of freedoms.
<p>
That's  why today it is very important to distinguish and explain
the difference between Free Software and OSS.
<p>
I hope to have contributed to it.

<br><br><h2>How  do  you  think  Chilean  Linuxers  could be motivated to
participate in or begin Free Software projects?</h2>

<p>
Ouch!  It's  not  just a matter of getting in. You have to know a
lot first.
<p>
Working  in a Free Software project requires people with a lot of
knowledge, not just the will to participate.
<p>
I'd  recommend  first  to get very well informed about what Free
Software  is, and if they share the underlying philosophy, to get
involved  in an area they know very well (as it could be the same
as they worked on with their thesis).


<br><br><h2>How do you see Dillo's future?</h2>

<p>
That's  something  that's  not  yet  defined,  as  it regrettably
doesn't depend on us alone...
<p>
Technically,  we  have  all the expertise, will and ideas to make
"big  things" with Dillo. BTW, what we have developed thus far
already makes a big difference!
<p>
For instance, some may have heard about the "digital divide".
<p>
(the  so-called  "digital divide" is the gap that exists between
those  who  have access to information technologies and those
who  don't.  It  is  easy to see that in an interconnected world,
with   an   ever-growing   portion   of  human  activities  being
encompassed  by  the  informatics  realm,  this  divide  comes to
constitute   what  we  may  call  the  "illiteracy  of  the  21st
century").
<p>
Thus,  it  is  easy  to  understand why the UN and most countries
(developed  or  not)  are  concerned  about it. Consequently they
hold  summits  to  debate  how  to  close  the divide, and assign
thousands of millions of dollars to the issue.
<p>
Regrettably,  as  the  UN's  general  secretary has
<a href='http://news.com.com/2010-1069-964507.html'>declared:</a>
<p>
"But  bridging  the  digital  divide is not going to be easy. Too
often,  state  monopolies charge exorbitant prices for the use of
bandwidth.  Governments  need to do much more to create effective
institutions  and  supportive  regulatory  frameworks  that  will
attract foreign investment; more generally, they must also review
their policies and arrangements to make sure they are not denying
their people the opportunities offered by the digital revolution.
" 
(think about it)
<p>

It is easy to see that the economic interests involved are huge.
<p>
A small example:
<p>
Dillo  is a tangible demonstration that the technology to build a
PDA  (pocket-sized  computer) integrating a web browser and phone
EXISTS today.
<p>
Dillo  is  a tangible demonstration that it is possible to make a
home  phone  with  a  screen and web browser for near US $250 and
bring Internet access to a huge amount of people.
<p>
Why can't those products be found in the market?
<p>
If  we  consider  the thousands of millions of dollars in profits
that  the  IT market generates as it is today, is easy to understand
why they don't want to change it!
<p>
In brief: the technology to bring low-cost Internet access to the
masses  exists  today.  It  only  needs  the  willingness of some
government to do it.
<p>
In  fact,  in Chile, with GNU/Linux + Dillo, today it is possible
with an old computer and a phone line, to access a broad range of
information  available  from  government  servers,  universities,
newspapers,  magazines,  forums, etc... (and not even according a
simple standardization policy!).
<p>
Our  project  is  seeking  funds  that  allow for a small team of
stable  developers,  with  full-time  dedication,  with a view to
accelerate and improve our browser and thus contribute to build a
better-informed society.
<p>
All the information with regard to the Dillo project can be found
in our <a href='index.html'>web site</a>.


<br><br><h2>Is there any project where Dillo is used "commercially"?</h2>

<p>
Yes. there's an
<a href='http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT2869412121.html'>
interesting  project</a> implementing an information intranet for
hotels over embedded devices (USA).
<p>
Moreover,  I've  been  told  that  in an Australian university an
electronic  information  system was implemented over flat screens
controlled centrally from a web interface.
<p>
One time we received a thankful note from a person that completed
a heterogeneous research work (information retrieval) quickly and
efficiently because of using dillo.
<p>
The  possibilities are many, it only takes some knowledge and the
will to do it.


<br><br><h2>In what ways could the Dillo project be helped?</h2>

<p>
I think in three ways:
<ol>
  <li> Making direct contributions such as patches and source code
      (which requires a lot of knowledge and experience)
  <li> Talking  about  it!  Knowing  the  project objectives, and
communicating  them  to  people.  Making  people  see  that  it's
possible to have good Internet surfing with an old computer and a
phone line.
       <p>
       Reading  manuals  and  sites,  investigating  with  Dillo,
enjoying  the  speed and ease with which it can be done, and then
go spreading the word to other people.
  <li> Helping us to find a way to fund the project.
</ol>


<br><br><h2>How do you see the Chilean Linux community?</h2>

<p>
Really,  I  haven't  had the time to get involved, but I think it
is active to some degree, with national gatherings, events etc.
<p>
BTW,  today  Nov  29,  there's  a  national event of GNU/Linux in
Concepción.
<p>
I'd  like  to  participate  and  give  a speech, maybe in another
opportunity.
<p>
I  also  believe that the UTFSM's "linux" mailing list has done a
lot for the community, gathering a lot of people towards a common
interest focus.


<br><br><h2>Finally, what's your opinion of tux.cl?</h2>

<p>
It is an interesting project that's just beginning.
<p>
How could it be improved?
<p>
First  you  must  define  what  you  want  to  do:  that  is, the
publication's objective.
 
After  surfing  the  net a while and getting the feel of it being
full  of  information  about  GNU/Linux, another news site is not
interesting;  the point to take advantage of is that you write in
Spanish  and  know  the  Chilean  grounds,  so  you  can  deliver
information that can't be found anywhere else...
